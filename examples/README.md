# ORY Editor Examples

Please follow the [installation steps](../README.md) first, and then run:

* `npm run start:article` - a New York Times article that was rebuilt using the ORY Editor. This
repository is primarily a tech demo and optimized for manual testing.
* `npm run start:spa` - a simple single page app for a more visual example.

Please note that `start` scripts run in development mode, which has a negative impact on performance.
